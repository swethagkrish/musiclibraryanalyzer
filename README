Acknowledgments
Most of the information I used from the assignment came from our discussions
and my notes from class. There were a few resources that I used in addition to
that.
https://phoenixnap.com/kb/grep-multiple-strings
This link helped me with Grep and how to format it and more in-depth than
in class - especially with multiple patterns.
https://www.booleanworld.com/guide-linux-find-command/
Used this for more information and examples on how to use find especially for
-iname
https://www.tecmint.com/sort-command-linux/
Helped me learn how to sort with the cut command

More information on cut.

How to Run the Files
The best way to run the scripts is by placing them inside the selected Music
folder (so that it is inside Music/).

Observations
Most of the commands from the warmup were useful to run the detailed
report which was probably why it was part of the assignment. I noticed to
get the Multi-Disk albums it took about a few seconds longer than all the other
commands. I wasn't able to figure out what that was, but the output printed
what I needed to it.

Test Data
While my test data was not as detailed as I wanted it to be, I mostly covered
a few cases just to reassure me of my work. Mainly had a few duplicate albums
with LatinRemixes and Greatest Hits so that I can be assured that instruction
does work. All the instructions worked as they should showing that the
commands that I wrote could be transfered to another music file if needed
